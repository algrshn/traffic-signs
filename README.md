# Traffic signs recognition in TensorFlow2

This is an exercise in image recognition. The goal is to train a simple convolutional network to recognize some traffic signs.

### Data

The final dataset is the result of compilation from a number of sources. The basis is a LISA (Laboratory for Intelligent & Safe Automobiles) dataset available [here](http://cvrr.ucsd.edu/LISA/lisa-traffic-sign-dataset.html).
