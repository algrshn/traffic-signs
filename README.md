# Traffic signs recognition in TensorFlow2

This is an exercise in image recognition. The goal is to train a simple convolutional network to recognize some traffic signs.

### Data

The final dataset is the result of compilation from a number of sources. The basis is a LISA (Laboratory for Intelligent & Safe Automobiles) dataset available [here](http://cvrr.ucsd.edu/LISA/lisa-traffic-sign-dataset.html). LISA dataset is a set of frames with annotations, out of which we extracted images of traffic signs with labels. We chose to keep only 12 categories of traffic signs, as they were best represented.
